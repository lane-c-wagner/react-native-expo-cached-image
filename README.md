Cached image component for Expo's managed workflow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

`yarn add react-native-expo-cached-image`

## üöÄ Quick Start

```javascript
import CachedImage from 'react-native-expo-cached-image';

// In render()
<CachedImage showIndicator = {true} 
             cachedImageStyles = {styles.imageStyle}                                        
             activityIndicatorStyle = {styles.activityIndicatorStyle}                                                 
             activityIndicatorColor = {'black'}
             activityIndicatorSize = {'small'} source={{ uri: 'https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QVault-app.png' }}/>
```

The CachedImage component downloads the image to the user's local filesystem using a deterministic hash
of the URI as the path key. If the image is already downloaded, it will be rendered without re-downloading.

### Props

CachedImage is a direct wrapper of [react-native Image](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image)
and matches it's API. As such, all of its props are available as props to CachedImage. Styles are also passed down.

If you want to show Activity Indicator while downloading the image/even while importing the cached image, pass the activityIndicator related props. 

For the color, you can either pass hexcode or even the color name. ActivityIndicator is actually a react-native component which actually support all of its features. When it come to size, it supports 'small', 'medium', 'large' 

Also you can pass the style for the Image as the prop, which is actually mandatory, otherwise Cached Image will not display.

Same applies for both Image and ImageBackground. 

#### ImageBackground

CachedImage can optionally be used as a wrapper of [react-native ImageBackground](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/imagebackground). To do so, pass in the prop isBackground={true}.

```javascript

import CachedImage from 'react-native-expo-cached-image';

// In render()
<CachedImage isBackground source = {{ uri: 'https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QVault-app.png' }}
             showIndicator = {true} 
             cachedImageStyles = {styles.imageStyle}                                        
             activityIndicatorStyle = {styles.activityIndicatorStyle}                                                 
             activityIndicatorColor = {'black'}
             activityIndicatorSize = {'small'}/>



```
